# Image-Filtering-and-Hybrid-Images
This repository presents is an image convolution function (image filtering) used it to create hybrid images. The technique was invented by Oliva, Torralba, and Schyns in 2006, and published in a paper at SIGGRAPH. High frequency image content tends to dominate perception but, at a distance, only low frequency (smooth) content is perceived. By blending high and low frequency content, we can create a hybrid image that is perceived differently at different distances. This project is in a computer vision course.
